# Challenge 1

## Description

This is the first challenge for the class. For this challenge, we will be refactoring the existing code to improve or modify the script. This will enhance the current webpage elements.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In short: the webpage must meet accessibility standards. Through the refactoring, we should:
1. Make use of semantic elements (header, section, figure) instead of divs whenever appropriate
2. Add 'alt' attributes to image tags.
3. Heading attributes should remain in a sequential order.
4. Elements of the page should follow a logical structure. 

## Conclusion

1. It is important to maintain accessibility within your webpage for users who rely on accessibility features.
2. It is important to keep your script within a logical structure if you want the right outcomes.
